  # T1-2 — one cask, both Macs. `arch` maps the machine Homebrew is running on
  # onto the string tauri-bundler writes into the DMG name (aarch64 / x64), and
  # `sha256` takes one digest per architecture. These two stanzas ARE the
  # on_arm/on_intel mechanism rather than an alternative to it: both set
  # Homebrew's own `@on_system_blocks_exist` flag, in `def arch` and
  # `def sha256` (Library/Homebrew/cask/dsl.rb), so the cask carries the same
  # per-architecture branch with one url and one caveats block instead of two
  # of each. `arch` sits above `version` because that is the stanza order
  # Homebrew's own cop enforces (rubocops/cask/constants/stanza.rb).

  version "0.14.1"
  # Both digests are real (checked into checksums-sha256.txt on the v0.14.1
  # release) — the two-leg build matrix has published an Intel DMG since
  # 0.12.0. An earlier revision of this comment warned that the intel digest
  # was a 64-zero PLACEHOLDER; that stopped being true once the Intel leg
  # shipped, and the warning outlived the condition it described.

  # Straight from the GitHub release, which is where the artifact and its
  # published checksum canonically live. It used to point at the marketing
  # site's own /downloads copy, and that mirror is updated by a separate
  # deploy — so between publishing a release and redeploying the site, this
  # url 404'd and every `brew install --cask clockwork` failed. One source.

  # A `depends_on arch: :arm64` line stood beside it until T1-2. It was true of
  # every release up to 0.11.2, and it is the one line that would refuse the
  # Intel install this cask now offers — so it goes with the change that makes
  # the Intel DMG exist, not after someone reports that brew skipped their Mac.

  app "Clockwork.app"

  # `clockwork` on PATH (BUN-3): symlinks this file into the Homebrew prefix
  # bin dir. It is a thin wrapper, staged by tools/stage-bundle.mjs, that execs
  # the app's own bundled Node against its own bundled CLI entry point — no
  # system Node required. bundled-resources-staged.test.ts guards that the
  # staging script actually places a file at this exact path.
  #
  # 0.14.1 is the first DMG that ships the wrapper (verified in the published
  # DMG before this cask went to the tap). `binary` only symlinks and does not
  # check the target exists, so never point this cask at an older version.
  # docs/cli.md names the full command for installs that predate it.

  # The build is not notarised — an Apple Developer certificate is $99/year and
  # this is an early release. Homebrew 6 removed --no-quarantine and
  # HOMEBREW_CASK_OPTS does not accept it either, so quarantine is always
  # applied and the user clears it afterwards. Homebrew still verifies the
  # sha256 above, so this is a binary whose hash was checked for you.
  caveats <<~EOS
    Clockwork is not notarised by Apple yet, so macOS quarantines it.

    Clear the flag before first launch:
      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Clockwork.app

    From 0.11.0 this cask installs everything: the app carries the daemon and
    its own Node runtime, and registers a background agent on first launch.
    There is nothing else to install and no token to paste.

    The `clockwork` terminal CLI is on your PATH now too — try `clockwork
    status` once the app has launched at least once.

    You do need at least one provider CLI you are already logged into
    (claude, codex, opencode or hermes) on your PATH.
